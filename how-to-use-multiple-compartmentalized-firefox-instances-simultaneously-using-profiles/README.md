### Step 1: create Firefox profile

```shell
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -p
```

### Step 2: open Firefox profile

> Heads-up: in the following command, make sure you replace `work` by the name of your profile. If the name includes spaces, please use quotes (example: `-p "Work Profile"`).

```shell
nohup /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -p work --no-remote > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
